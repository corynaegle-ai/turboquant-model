# Quantization Pipeline

This document describes how TurboQuant compresses model weights from full-precision (bf16/fp32) down to 4-bit indices, covering the single-pass pipeline, residual (multi-pass) quantization, and the merge optimization.

## Overview

The quantization pipeline transforms each `nn.Linear` weight matrix $W \in \mathbb{R}^{M \times N}$ (where $M$ = out_features, $N$ = in_features) into a compact representation:

| Component | Shape | Dtype | Purpose |
|-----------|-------|-------|---------|
| `indices_packed` | $(M, N/2)$ | uint8 | Two 4-bit codebook indices per byte |
| `weight_norms` | $(M,)$ or $(M, G)$ | float32 | Row or group norms for rescaling |
| `codebook` | $(2^b,)$ | float32 | Lloyd-Max centroids (shared globally) |
| `seed` | scalar | int | Rotation seed for reproducibility |

At 4-bit, this achieves roughly **4× compression** vs bf16.

## Single-Pass Quantization

The core algorithm processes each weight matrix group-by-group (group size $d$, default 128). For each group $g$:

### Step 1: Row Normalization

$$W_{\text{norm}}^{(g)} = \frac{W^{(g)}}{\|W^{(g)}\|_2}, \qquad \alpha^{(g)} = \|W^{(g)}\|_2$$

Each row of the group slice is divided by its $\ell_2$-norm. The norm $\alpha$ is stored separately and applied during inference. This ensures the rotated coordinates have a known variance ($1/d$), which is critical for the Lloyd-Max codebook to be optimal.

**Implementation:** `model.py → _quantize_weight()`

### Step 2: Random Rotation

$$Y^{(g)} = W_{\text{norm}}^{(g)} \cdot \Pi_g^T$$

A random orthogonal matrix $\Pi_g$ decorrelates the weight coordinates. After rotation, each coordinate is approximately i.i.d. $\mathcal{N}(0, 1/d)$ — the ideal input distribution for scalar Lloyd-Max quantization.

Two rotation methods are supported:

| Method | Storage | Compute | Constraint |
|--------|---------|---------|------------|
| **QR** (Haar random) | $O(d^2)$ | $O(d^2)$ | None |
| **Hadamard** (Walsh-Hadamard + random signs) | $O(d)$ | $O(d \log d)$ | $d$ must be power of 2 |

The rotation matrix is deterministic given the seed, so only the seed needs to be stored.

**Implementation:** `rotation.py → generate_rotation_matrix()` (QR) or `hadamard_rotate()` (Hadamard)

### Step 3: Scaling

$$Y_{\text{scaled}}^{(g)} = Y^{(g)} \cdot \sqrt{d}$$

Since rotation preserves norms and each coordinate has variance $1/d$, multiplying by $\sqrt{d}$ brings the coordinates to unit variance: $\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$. This is exactly the distribution for which the Lloyd-Max codebook is computed.

### Step 4: Scalar Quantization

$$\text{idx}_{m,k} = \text{searchsorted}(\text{boundaries}, Y_{\text{scaled},m,k})$$

Each scalar coordinate is independently quantized using the Lloyd-Max optimal boundaries for $\mathcal{N}(0,1)$. At 4 bits, there are 16 centroids and 15 decision boundaries.

**Implementation:** `codebook.py → get_codebook()`

### Step 5: 4-bit Packing

$$\text{packed}_{m, k/2} = \text{lo}_k \;|\; (\text{hi}_{k+1} \ll 4)$$

Consecutive pairs of 4-bit indices are packed into a single uint8 byte, halving the storage for the index tensor.

**Implementation:** `quantize.py → pack_4bit()`

### Complete Single-Pass Pseudocode

```
for each group g in [0, n_groups):
    W_g = W[:, g*d : (g+1)*d]                        # (M, d)
    norms = ||W_g||₂  (per row)                        # (M,)
    W_norm = W_g / norms                               # (M, d)
    Y = W_norm @ Pi_g.T                                # (M, d)  rotate
    Y_scaled = Y * sqrt(d)                             # (M, d)  to N(0,1)
    indices = searchsorted(boundaries, Y_scaled)       # (M, d)  quantize
    indices = clamp(indices, 0, 2^b - 1)
    packed[:, g*d//2 : (g+1)*d//2] = pack_4bit(indices)

store: packed (uint8), norms (float32), codebook (float32), seed (int)
```

**Entry point:** `quantize.py → turboquant_quantize_packed()` for standalone use, or `model.py → quantize_model()` for full-model quantization.

## Residual Quantization (Multi-Pass)

Single-pass 4-bit quantization introduces noticeable error. Residual quantization dramatically reduces this by running multiple passes, each quantizing the error left by the previous pass.

### Rotation Strategies

The choice of rotation seed across passes affects both quality and whether the fast merge optimization is available:

| Strategy | Seeds | Merge? | Quality | Use Case |
|----------|-------|--------|---------|----------|
| **different** (default) | Unique seed per pass | ❌ | Best | Max quality, no merge needed |
| **shared** | Same seed all passes | ✅ | Lowest | When merge to single-pass is required |
| **alternating** | Two seeds, alternating | ❌ | Near-best | Balance of diversity and simplicity |

With **different** rotations, each pass projects the residual into an independent random basis, so quantization errors are uncorrelated across passes. **Shared** rotation reuses the same basis, which makes errors correlated but enables the fast-path merge (see Merging below). **Alternating** uses two seeds cycling $s_a, s_b, s_a, s_b, \ldots$ — nearly as good as independent seeds while requiring only two rotation matrices.

Benchmark results on Qwen3.5-0.8B (4 × 2-bit):

| Strategy | PPL | KLD |
|----------|-----|-----|
| different | 17.87 | 0.0034 |
| alternating | 18.09 | 0.0041 |
| shared | 22.24 | 0.0498 |

The `--rotation-strategy` CLI flag selects the strategy; default is `different`.

### Two-Pass Pipeline

```
Pass 1:  W_hat1 = TQ(W,         bit_width=b₁, seed=s₁)
         R      = W - W_hat1
Pass 2:  R_hat  = TQ(R,          bit_width=b₂, seed=s₂)
         W_approx = W_hat1 + R_hat
```

Total storage is $b_1 + b_2$ bits per weight. A **4+4 residual** (8 total bits) achieves near-lossless quality: PPL 14.28 vs baseline 14.29 on Qwen3.5-0.8B, KLD only 0.002 nats.

When `rotation_strategy="shared"`, $s_1 = s_2$ (same seed for both passes), enabling the merge optimization. With `"different"` (default), $s_1 \neq s_2$ for maximum quality.

**Implementation:** `residual.py → residual_quantize_packed()`

### N-Pass Pipeline

For more than two passes, three rotation strategies are available:

**Shared rotation** — a single seed enables the fast merge optimization:

```
for k in 1..n_passes:
    W_hat_k = TQ(R_{k-1}, bit_width=b, seed=s)   # same seed s for all passes
    R_k = R_{k-1} - W_hat_k
    W_approx += W_hat_k
```

**Alternating rotation** — two seeds cycle for better diversity:

```
for k in 1..n_passes:
    seed_k = s_a if k is odd else s_b              # alternate between two seeds
    W_hat_k = TQ(R_{k-1}, bit_width=b, seed=seed_k)
    R_k = R_{k-1} - W_hat_k
    W_approx += W_hat_k
```

MSE decreases monotonically with each additional pass.

**Implementation:** `residual.py → multi_residual_quantize_packed()` (shared), `residual.py → alternating_residual_quantize_packed()` (alternating)

## Merging Multi-Pass to Single-Pass

When all passes share the same rotation seed, the rotation factors out of the sum, enabling a merge that avoids the expensive inverse rotation:

### Fast-Path Merge (Shared Rotation)

Since $\hat{W}_k^{(g)} = \frac{\alpha_k}{\sqrt{d}} \cdot C_k[\mathbf{i}_k] \cdot \Pi_g$ for all passes, the sum becomes:

$$\tilde{Y}^{(g)} = \sum_k \frac{\alpha_k}{\sqrt{d}} \cdot C_k[\mathbf{i}_k]$$

This sum is computed entirely in the **rotated domain** — no inverse rotation needed. The merged result is then re-normalized and re-quantized into a single-pass representation:

```
for each group g:
    Y_sum = Σ_k (norms_k * codebook_k[indices_k] / sqrt(d))   # sum in rotated domain
    norms_merged = ||Y_sum||                                     # new norms
    Y_norm = Y_sum / norms_merged                                # re-normalize
    indices_merged = searchsorted(boundaries, Y_norm * sqrt(d))  # re-quantize
```

**Result:** A single packed representation with the same format as single-pass, but approximating the multi-pass quality.

> **Note:** `merge_and_requantize` requires all passes to share the same rotation seed (`rotation_strategy="shared"`). With `"different"` or `"alternating"` strategies, passes cannot be merged in the rotated domain because the rotation matrices differ.

**Implementation:** `residual.py → merge_and_requantize()`

### Why Merge?

| Property | Multi-pass (separate) | Merged (single-pass) |
|----------|----------------------|---------------------|
| Storage | $n \times$ single-pass | $1 \times$ single-pass |
| Inference cost | $n$ rotations + $n$ matmuls per group | 1 rotation + 1 matmul per group |
| Quality | Best (no re-quantization loss) | Slightly worse (re-quantization) |

Merging trades a small accuracy loss for halved inference latency and storage.

**Module-level merge:** `module.py → TurboQuantLinear.merge_passes()`

## Model-Level Quantization

`quantize_model()` orchestrates the full pipeline over an `nn.Module`:

1. Iterate all `nn.Linear` layers (optionally skip embeddings / lm_head)
2. For each layer:
   - Run single-pass quantization → create `TurboQuantLinear`
   - If residual configured: dequantize pass 1, compute residual, quantize pass 2, call `set_pass2()`
   - Replace the original `nn.Linear` in the model
3. Log compression statistics (original size → compressed size, ratio)

**Implementation:** `model.py → quantize_model()`

## Saved Format

`save_quantized()` writes the following directory structure using safetensors:

```
output_dir/
├── turboquant_config.json         # TurboQuantConfig (JSON)
├── model.safetensors              # All quantized layer tensors + codebook
├── non_quantized.safetensors      # Non-linear params (LayerNorm, embeddings, etc.)
└── config.json                    # (optional) HuggingFace model config
```

The `model.safetensors` file contains tensors keyed by layer name:

| Key pattern | Dtype | Content |
|-------------|-------|---------|
| `codebook` | float32 | Shared Lloyd-Max centroids |
| `{name}.indices` | uint8 | Packed 4-bit indices (M, N/2) |
| `{name}.norms` | float32 | Per-row/group norms |
| `{name}.bias` | float32 | (optional) bias vector |
| `{name}.pass2_indices` | uint8 | (optional) residual packed indices |
| `{name}.pass2_norms` | float32 | (optional) residual norms |
| `{name}.pass2_codebook` | float32 | (optional) residual codebook |

`load_quantized()` also supports the legacy `.pt` format (per-file `layers/` directory) for backward compatibility.

**Implementation:** `model.py → save_quantized()` / `load_quantized()`
